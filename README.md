# BIS15W2024FINAL-Hugo-Ni

Hello This is Hugo Mahatdejkul and Ni Tang's final project for BIS 15W 2024!
We are in group 8 :)
We were looking into the exciting plant data set collected from Ni's very own lab.
The data follows the growth of broomrapes, parasitic plants, in the presence of different hosts!
I know it sound super exciting right? Anyway we worked on creating an app and seeing which plants hosted the largest number of broomrapes, among other things
